Definition

perceives environment -> takes actions to maximize success
founded in 1950s
two general areas:
 - Symbolic AI
    - directly mimic all processes of human cognition
        - percepbtion
        - robotics
        - learning
        - pattern recognition
 - Statistical AI
    - narrow down problem
        -> more efficient models
    - solve exact task
has very broad deffinition
 - Simple things like
    - search engines
    - recommendation systems
 - more complex things like:
    - speech recognition
    - self driving cars
    - automated decision-making
usually utilizes machine learning
    - algorithm that improves through experience and data
    - trains on specific dataset do accieve similar results with new data
    - area with most headlines: Deep learing
        - uses neural network
            - ispired by brain & other biological systems

Example

GPT3

birth year: 2020
GPT = Generative Pre-trained Transformer
By Open AI (founded by Elon Musk and others)
deep learning algorithm
Artificial general intelligence
 -> aims at doing everything a human does
3rd generation of GPT-n series
one of the biggest models with 175 billion parameters
hard to differenciate between it and human
 -> Researchers warn of potential risk
Now licensed by Microsoft
 -> API usage still allowed
Trained on 40GB on internet data
example implementations on internet
 - AI Dungeons
    -> amazing demo
